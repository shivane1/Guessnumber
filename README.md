Game Description: "Guess the Random Number Between 1 and 100"
In this game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player's goal is to guess the number. After each guess, the computer provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too low, too high, or correct. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number.

Detailed Steps:
Game Initialization:

The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The player is prompted to enter a guess.
Gameplay Loop:

After each guess, the computer checks the player's input against the randomly generated number.
If the guess is too low, the computer informs the player that the guess is "too low" and prompts another guess.
If the guess is too high, the computer informs the player that the guess is "too high" and prompts another guess.
If the guess is correct, the computer congratulates the player and displays the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.
Game End:

Once the player guesses the correct number, the game ends.
